**TODO:** Add your screen captures to a new directory called [images](images).
OK!
**HINT:** Embed your screen captures as requested in the sections below. You can embed the image using the following syntax:

```
![Screen Capture #1](images/my-screen-capture.jpg)
```

The first argument is the Alt-text for the image. The second argument is the path to the image. Make sure your images are readable and that you save them in a JPG or PNG format.

5 pts Your GitHub account showing that is has been forked from the depaulcdm/spring-petclinic repository. This doesn’t actually need an image – I can see it from your repository.

5 pts Your GitHub Actions dashboard showing a successful first build.
